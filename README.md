# AI-_-room_allocation
This project solves classroom or meeting room allocation using Graph Colouring with a Branch &amp; Bound approach. Sessions are represented as graph nodes, and overlaps create conflicts (edges). Colors denote rooms. A greedy method gives an initial solution, while Branch &amp; Bound optimizes it to use the minimum number of rooms efficiently.
